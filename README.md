# ATM Machine

## Tech Stack: React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML.
## This project tracks the total funds in a bank account: including deposits and withdraws. The ATM uses React to manage the state of various UI elements and to validate form content.

### To Run: Clone the repository; In command prompt, find the project location; Run npm install http-server; Run http-server -c-1; Open your browser and navigate to the localhost.
##### My next enhancement will be to reset the input field after each submission.
