# ATM Machine

## This project keeps track of the total funds in a bank account, using depsits to add funds and cash back to take out funds. The ATM uses React components to manage the state of various UI elements and to validate form content.

### To the original code provided by MIT, I added a green background and changed the font. I also added an alert to be shown if the user attempts to take out more funds than are in the account. In this scenario, the account balance is not changed until the transaction is valid (the amount of cash back requested is equal to or less than the amount of funds available). I limited the input field to positive numbers only. 
##### My next enhancement will be to reset the input field after each submission.
